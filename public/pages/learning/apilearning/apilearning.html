<p>Data, it's all about data. We can talk easier, using standardized API formats. Of course, discussing APIs, its not just humans -- other websites and apps can use API calls as well -- that's the strength of it.</p>

<p>Imagine I run a weather app. There's lots of internal logic there -- but if I stick to the API format for my user-facing design, you can query my weather data easily.</p>

<p>It works like this: data comes down to four modes (there's more but think of four): creating, updating, deleting and reading -- or CRUD, for short. The API format has a standard form for each of these data operations, and with them, apps can "talk" to each other more easily. Humans too.</p>

<p>Alright, details: On my server, I'll have a range of endpoints (open adresses that listen for traffic), and if you hit one of those, it'll give you data in a predictable manner -- like JSON.</p>
