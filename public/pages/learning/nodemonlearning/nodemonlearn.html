    I have learned about Nodemon. I'm not sure how to pronounce it. "No-Demon"? "Node-mon"?
</p>

    Nodemon is an extension for NodeJS which keeps an eye on the files you're working on. When Nodemon detects changes in the files, it restarts the NodeJS server.
    This is handy because it means I dont have to go to my console and restart the server in order to test the changes.
    Normally, without Nodemon, every time I made changes in my code, I would have to press <kbd>ctrl + Ã¦</kbd> (to go to console in VSCode), <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd> (terminates currently-running program in VSCode terminal) and then followed by <kbd>node app.js</kbd> (to start the server app again). At this point the server would restart and I would then have to open my browser in order to view the changes.

    The above may not sound like much, but if each restart operation takes six seconds, it vvery quickly adds up over the course of app development.

    Since Nodemon can be found in the Node Package Manager, installing Nodemon into a NodeJS environment is relatively straightforward: you go <code>npm i nodemon</code> and hit enter.
    After NPM is done installing Nodemon, you can costumize which files Nodemon scans for, by creating a file (<code>touch nodemon.json</code> will do that, in terminal) the root of the project -- make sure this file is called "nodemon.json".
    In the nodemon.json file, you can add any type of file extension you like, and nodemon'll then  scan for those file types also.
</p>

<p>
    Once Nodemon is installed, you call <kbd>nodemon app.js</kbd> in the terminal to have Nodemon start up and "watch" that directory for changes.
    This also causes nodeJS to start the app, as it would regularly.
