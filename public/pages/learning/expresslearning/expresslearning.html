    Express is a NodeJS framework -- this means that Express is a set of pre-built sets of code designed to solve a specific set of tasks in a specific manner.
    Specifically, Express handles server setup on behalf of NodeJS. Recall that NodeJS has the "http" module -- NodeJS uses this module to create servers, but, to do so, the programmer must
    set a bunch of variables. Express does away with that by making assumptions about what the programmer wants the server to do.

    To use Express, you gotta have Express installed in the NodeJS project (Node Package Manager handles this), and you gotta define a part of the NodeJS code (but much less than what you'd have to define if you were just using regular NodeJS).
    Let's start with installing Express: in the directory of the NodeJS program into which you want to install Express, enter in the terminal, <kbd>npm i express</kbd>.
    This command calls the Node Package Manager (<kbd>npm</kbd>) to install (<kbd>i</kbd>) Express (that's the <kbd>express</kbd> part) -- and then hit <code>enter</code>!

    On hitting enter, NPM will do all kinds of scary things. If you were to examine the package.json file, you'd notice a new line has been added: the <pre>  "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.18.2",</pre>, which indicates (to the NPM) that Express is a requirement.
    You can also do this in reverse: if you manually add the above "<kbd>requirements</kbd>" line to the package.json file and then run <kbd>npm i</kbd> (notice there's no <kbd>express</kbd> this time!), the NPM will examine the package.json, notice the Express dependency, and install it. Neat!
