    I have learned about NodeJS.
</p>

<p>
    NodeJS is a subset of JavaScript. It is designed to handle web applications and network applications. It has many modules for handling many different things.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most commonly used NodeJS modules is "http". As the name hints, the http module is meant to handle hypertext transfer protocol services, such as serving a web page.
</p>

<p>
    A typical scenario for NodeJS would be setting up a server to listen (on a port) for incoming calls -- if a call is heard by the NodeJS server, it'll respond with... well, with anything you give it, really!
</p>

<p>
    My flow for a new NodeJS program consists of first creating the directory in which I will place my code (this will be my working directory).
    You can create a directory in any manner you wish -- <kbd>ctrl + shift + N</kbd> on Windows in a folder view in Explorer will generate a new folder. You can also use <code>mkdir NEWDIRECTORY</code> in the console or terminal, where "NEWDIRECTORY" is the name you wish to give the new directory.
</p>

<p>
    After I've created the directory, I'll move into it -- the terminal can do this with the <kbd>cd NEWDIRECTORY</kbd> call -- "cd" is short for "change directory". Once inside the directory, I'll call <kbd>npm init</kbd> in the terminal. This command calls the Node Package Manager (NPM) to initialise (init) the directory.
    The npm initialiser will ask a bunch of questions -- most of them can be defaulted, but you'll want to fill out the project name and author name.
    At the end, the initialiser will create a file named "package.json" and one called "package-lock.json", these are config files for NPM.
