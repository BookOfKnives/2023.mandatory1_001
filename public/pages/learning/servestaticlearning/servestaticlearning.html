    The web is not a safe place. Normally, you don't want to expose anything to the web, except the parts you DO want to expose.
    In order to achieve this, NodeJS lets you define a folder for public viewing -- NodeJS calls this the statically-served folder.

    In order to do this, we use the call <kbd>app.use(express.static("DIRECTORY"));</kbd>, where DIRECTORY is the folder we wish use set as the static folder. For instance, if I had a folder named "public", the call would be
    <kbd>app.use(express.static("public"));</kbd>. 
</p>

    After this is done, you can use the folders and files in the public folder as a path for any web resources your server has. Quite handy!
